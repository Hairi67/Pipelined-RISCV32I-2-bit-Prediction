# Pipelined-RISCV32I-2-bit-Prediction
This project implements a pipelined RISC-V 32I processor with an integrated 2-bit branch predictor to enhance instruction flow efficiency. The design follows a five-stage pipeline architecture (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback) to improve instruction throughput.
